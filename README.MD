-This is a terminal based reproduction of the popular game Mario

1) My code for the game spans for 6 files, namely
	boards.py
	inputchar.py
	main.py
	characters.py
	Items.py
	Obstacles.py

2) Use "w" or "W" to Jump
   "a" or "A" to move left
   "d" or "D" to move right
   "g" or "G" to fire the weapon(when you have it)

3) You can go inside one of the pipes(the last one) where you'll find a gun that can be used to kill the boss enemy.

4) There are 2 types of enemies, normal enemies and a boss enemy.
   Normal enemies can be killed by stomping on them and the boss enemy can be killed by using a Gun.

5) There are sounds that are going to play during different things. All these sounds are present in the Game Folder.
